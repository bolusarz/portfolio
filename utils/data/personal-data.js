  description: "My name is Adewusi Boluwatife. I am a software engineer with 5 years of experience. I have spent most of my career as a Frontend Engineer but I am not averse to the workings of a Backend Engineer. What differentiates me from others is my work ethic. I have worked at two startups so I know what it means to be accountable, to believe in a product so much that putting in the extra shift comes natural to me, to always be open to experimentation and the joy of seeing how useful a product is to a customer. This is what I believe i bring to the table asides from my programming skills",
